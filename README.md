# Bepuphysics-Unity
A bridge for Bepuphysics and Unity

Bepu physics source code: https://github.com/bepu/bepuphysics2

# Installation
- Require unity 2020.1a17 or higher (Previous version will crash as soon as you hit play).

# Performances
- Right now it's not hardware accelerated in Unity so until they had support for System.Numerics.Vectors it won't run as fast as it can.
